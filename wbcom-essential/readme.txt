3. Elementor widgets appear in the "Starter Templates" category
4. Gutenberg blocks appear in "Starter Pack" categories

= Requirements =

* PHP 8.0 or higher
* Elementor 3.0+ (for Elementor widgets)
* BuddyPress 10.0+ (for BuddyPress features)
* WooCommerce 7.0+ (for WooCommerce features)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Elementor installed? =

For Elementor widgets, yes. Gutenberg blocks work without Elementor - they're native WordPress blocks.

= What happens if BuddyPress isn't active? =

BuddyPress blocks only appear when BuddyPress is active. The plugin loads them conditionally.

= Can I use theme colors in blocks? =

Yes. All 45 blocks have a "Use Theme Colors" toggle in the Color Settings panel. When enabled, blocks inherit colors from your theme's CSS custom properties.

= Are blocks compatible with Full Site Editing? =

Yes. All blocks work in the Site Editor, post editor, and widget areas.
